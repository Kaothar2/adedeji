									<p>The "Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning" project aims to develop a robust system capable of identifying customers at risk of churn. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques on the provided dataset, and providing recommendations to the company, the aim is to implement targeted retention initiatives to reduce customer attrition, enhance customer loyalty, and maintain a competitive edge in the telecommunications industry. Before feeding the data into the machine learning model, extensive data preprocessing was performed. This included handling missing datas, scaling features. Additionally, feature engineering techniques were applied to extract relevant information from the raw data such as the short, medium and long term tenure.Several algorithms were experimented with including but not-limited to: Random Forest, Naive bayes, Support Vector Machine and Xgboost. After extensive experimentation and hyperparameter tuning, the final machine learning model was selected based on its performance and generalization capabilities </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Tanzania tourism Customer segmentation<br />

									<p>"The Tanzania Tourist spending behavior using unsupervised Machine Learning" project aims at leveraging ML to launch a targeted marketing ad campaign that is tailored to each specific group of tourists towards getting into the country. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques on the provided dataset, and providing recommendations to the Tanzania Tourism Board, the goal is to aid management understand features that affect tourist expenditure when visiting Tanzania accurately. I applied dimensionality reduction specifically the principal component analysis (pca) to reduce the dimensions of a large dataset, increasing the interpreatablilty and at the same minimizing information loss. Applied clustering algorithms K-Means to segment the tourists into distinct groups based on their travel and spending behaviors. Used the Elbow method and Silhouette scores to determine the optimal number of clusters. Finally Analyzed and interpreted each cluster to profile the different tourist segments.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Amazon product sentiment analyzer<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/image_2.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I led the development of a sentiment analysis system for a major e-commerce platform inundated with thousands of daily product reviews in the Electronics category on Amazon. The project aimed to automate the analysis of customer sentiments (positive, neutral, negative) and align them closely with star ratings to enable data-driven decision-making.I utilized a combination of pre-trained models (VADER and TextBlob) and custom-trained machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest). After thorough evaluation, Naive bayes was chosen for deployment because it showed fewer incorrect positive predictions for negative reviews compared to other models.The solution, integrated into a user-friendly web application using Flask and Streamlit, improved sentiment classification accuracy by over 20%, resulting in a 15% increase in customer satisfaction and a 10% boost in sales. The successful implementation led to the system's expansion across other product categories. </p>
